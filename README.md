# google-dorks-automation (tool to automate google dorking ).<br>

### How it Works  :
<br>- very easy to use just add your dorklist in the dork text file , all results will be saved in a text file <br>

#### Note : in this script i used google JSON API which have limited quota for each key  it  preform 100 search queries  daily And each query  fetch  100 result 
#### fortunately i created a pool of keys to switch between them and bypass this limit 
#### So if you want to make lot of searchs you have to  create lot of keys, now it have only 3 keys , However google keys are free just create them and add in GCSE Keys pool.txt
